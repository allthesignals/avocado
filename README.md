# What is this?

This is an attempt to create a mapping stack that is modular, runs on docker / kube(?), blockchain(jk), and can do a lot of cool stuff.

## What does this consist of 

- A tiler : to make tiles 
- A query api : to make queries 
- A database : To base data 
- An uploader : To upload stuff
- Some front end components to make it all easy 
-

## To start
Run `docker-compose up`
Run `./populate_db.sh`
Go to `localhost:4444/query.format?q=SELECT * FROM test_data`

## Can I contribute 

Probably  u can

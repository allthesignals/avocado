# What is this?

This is an attempt to create a mapping stack that is modular, runs on docker / kube(?), blockchain(jk), and can do a lot of cool stuff.

## What does this consist of 

- A tiler : to make tiles 
- A query api : to make queries 
- A database : To base data 
- An uploader : To upload stuff
- Some front end components to make it all easy
